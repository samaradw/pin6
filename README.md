## Welcome

Understanding versioning is crucial for maintaining software projects and communicating changes to users. This course will teach you how to implement semantic versioning and leverage GitHub's releases feature to organize and distribute your project effectively.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, project maintainers, and open source contributors.
- **What you'll learn**: Semantic versioning principles, creating and managing tags, and publishing GitHub releases.
- **What you'll build**: A versioned project with properly documented releases and automated release notes.
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Git and GitHub workflows.
- **How long**: 30-45 minutes.

### In this course, you'll learn how to:

1. Understand and apply semantic versioning principles
2. Create and manage Git tags
3. Publish GitHub releases with appropriate documentation

## Introduction to GitHub Releases

GitHub Releases are a way to package and provide software to your users. They're based on Git tags but provide additional features:

- **Release Notes**: Document what's changed since the last version
- **Binary Attachments**: Distribute compiled versions of your software
- **Semantic Versioning Support**: Follow the industry-standard versioning convention
- **Discoverability**: Make it easy for users to find stable versions of your project

Releases appear on your repository's releases page, providing a user-friendly interface where users can:
- See what's new in each version
- Download source code archives automatically generated by GitHub
- Access any additional files you've attached to the release

When combined with semantic versioning, releases become a powerful way to communicate the impact of changes and help users decide when to upgrade.
