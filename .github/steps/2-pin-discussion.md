# 📌 Step 2: Pin a Discussion Thread

Great job creating a discussion! 🎉  
Now let’s **pin** it to make it more visible to repository visitors.

## 📍 What is a pinned discussion?

Pinned discussions appear at the **top** of the Discussions page in your repository. This is useful for highlighting:

- Important announcements  
- Frequently asked questions (FAQs)  
- Community guidelines  
- Any content you want everyone to see first

## 🎯 Activity: Pin your discussion

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Discussions** tab in your repository.
2. Find the discussion you created titled **"Welcome to our repository!"**
3. Click the **three dots (⋯)** in the top-right corner of that discussion.
4. Select **"Pin discussion"** from the dropdown.

### 🔄 What’s next?

Wait about **20 seconds**, then refresh this page (the one you're reading).  
GitHub Actions will detect your pinned discussion and move you to the next step.

> 📌 **Note:** When a discussion is pinned, a pin icon appears next to the title and it moves to the top of the list in the Discussions tab.
