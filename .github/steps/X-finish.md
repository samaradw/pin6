By mastering these concepts, you've gained valuable skills that will help you:
- Communicate changes clearly to your users
- Manage project versions effectively
- Create professional and informative releases
- Follow industry best practices for versioning
- Structure your development workflow around meaningful releases

### What you've learned:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Understanding MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning
2. **Git Tags**: Creating version markers in your repository history
3. **GitHub Releases**: Publishing releases with documentation and assets

### What's next?

- Configure GitHub Actions to automatically create releases on tags
- Set up automated testing before publishing releases
- Explore integrating a changelog tool like `standard-version` or `release-it`
- Learn more about [GitHub Actions for automated releases](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-deployment)
- [Take another GitHub Skills course](https://github.com/skills)
- [Read more about semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)

### Did you know?

Many package managers like npm, PyPI, and RubyGems integrate deeply with semantic versioning to help users manage dependencies. The versioning skills you've learned here apply across the software development ecosystem!
