# Step 1: Understanding Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that communicates meaning about the underlying changes in a release. It makes it easy for developers to understand the impact of upgrades.

## üìù The SemVer Format

A semantic version number has three parts: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

Each number communicates specific kinds of changes:

- **MAJOR** version increments when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version increments when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version increments when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## üìù SemVer Examples

Let's look at some examples:

- `1.0.0`: Initial release
- `1.0.1`: Bug fixes, no new features
- `1.1.0`: New features added, backward compatible
- `2.0.0`: Breaking changes that require users to modify their code
- `1.0.0-alpha`: Pre-release version
- `1.0.0-beta.1`: Another pre-release version
